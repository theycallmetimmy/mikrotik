#This script is built to run every time a new DHCP lease is granted to a DHCP client.
#This script was built to track devices that attach to a guest wifi and send an email alert every time a new device connects to the network.
#It also adds a dynamic Address List entry to the firewall in case you need to manipulate the traffic for the new guest device.

#This was tested and used on WinBox RouterOS version 6.48.6.
#I have statically assigned DHCP entries in my DHCP lease table and the script does NOT send alerts for the "lease renewal" of the static entries.

#Add the below script to your Script tab of your DHCP server you want the script to run on - IP>DHCP Server>"DHCP server name">Script tab.

#The DHCP server script commands listed here are ONLY available from within the DHCP server Script tab of the MikroTik OS. 
#If you wish the entire MikroTik to be "aware" of the commands you are using, you will need to use global commands to 
#make the DHCP commands available to be used by other scripts under System>Scripts.
#I purposely did NOT do that as I wanted the commands to stay local inside the DHCP area.
