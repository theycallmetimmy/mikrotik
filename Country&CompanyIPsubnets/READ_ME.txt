#Once you create the firewall Address-List using the country/company files, what you do with the list is up to you. 
#You can block all attempts against your router(input rule)
#or you can block all attempts thru your router(forward rule). 
#An example of input rule is the default port used for WinBox. Maybe you
#want to ONLY access your MikroTik from within the United States, or Canada, or England. Using the prebuilt address lists, you can possibly lock down
#where your MikroTik is geographically available from, or lock down your port-forward rule to your camera system so it's only available from (example country).
#Building the firewall rules that use Address Lists is outside the scope of this section.
#If you made it this far, it is assumed you know what a firewall rule is and you know how to build one.
