#This script allows you to perform a MikroTik to MikroTik bandwidth test from Terminal, or in this case, from a saved script
#which you can run whenever or have it attached to a schedule.
#Obviously you will need to put in the correct username and password of the far end MikroTik(please do not use password as your password)
#Also, you will need the bandwidth server feature enabled on the far MikroTik. 
#I recommend firewalling the ports used if you plan on leaving it on for any amount of time.

#This bandwidth test is performed using bps and then converts it to Kbps in the log entry
#The formula to use in the local-tx-speed and remote-tx-speed areas is as follows
#1000bps=1kbps     so 1000000bps = 1000Kbps = 1Mbps
