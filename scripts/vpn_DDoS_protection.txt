##Here we will find how many times someone has tried connecting to your Mikrotik on the PPTP TCP
##port of 1723, or on the IPSec(L2TP) UDP port of 1701. Once the connection attempts reach 3 in a one minute
##period, the person will be blocked from even trying the VPN connection for 100days. The 100day timeframe 
##can be adjusted of course, and you can add more attempt chances if you so desire.

##Here is the PPTP rule, DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE RULES IN YOUR FIREWALL!! They have
##to remain in this order otherwise you will block all VPN access to your router immediately on first attempt.
