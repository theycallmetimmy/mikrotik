#Here are the scripts and scheduler for nightly backups of your Mikrotik. It is two different types of backup. 
#One is the direct non-encrypted backup that restores everything on your Mikrotik back to the time of Backup, 
#the other is a text output of the config of the Mikrotik.
#These are emailed to the email address of your choice IF you have email setup in your Mikrotik.

#You can change the scheduler to a different time or day if you want to. If you only want weekly backups, change “1d” (one day) to “7d” (seven days).
#If you want it to backup at a different time, change the “start-time=19:00:00” to another time.

#The way the backup scripts work is it only keeps one recent file on your Mikrotik. 
#It does NOT keep every backup from the beginning of time, so that way it won’t fill up your storage. 
#So if you look at your File listing, you will only have one backup of each file.

#Don’t forget to change your “send to” email to whatever you want it to send to.

#These are copy and paste scripts, so once you make your changes, copy the text to a Terminal window in Winbox.
#Tested on RouterOS v6.27 thru v6.30.2.
